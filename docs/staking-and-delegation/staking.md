# Staking with spacepussy.ai and keplr wallet

In addition to running your own subnet miner or subnet validator, you can delegate your TAO to the Opentensor Foundation validation pool. Delegating TAO simply means you are staking to the Opentensor Foundation's validator, instead of running your own subnet validator. To take back your staked TAO from the pool at any time, you can simply undelegate your TAO.

Follow the below steps:


1. Add your Cybertensor wallet to the [keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app) wallet in your browser (you will need your mnemonic to do this). 
After you have done so, navigate to [spacepussy.ai](https://spacepussy.ai/robot) and connect your account there.
