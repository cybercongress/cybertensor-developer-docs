# Staking with spacepussy.ai and keplr wallet

This document describes how you can stake using [https://spacepussy.ai](https://spacepussy.ai) and [keplr wallet](https://wallet.keplr.app).

In addition to running your own subnet miner or subnet validator, you can delegate your PUSSY to the validation pool. Delegating PUSSY simply means you are staking to the validator, instead of running your own subnet validator. To take back your staked PUSSY from the pool at any time, you can simply undelegate your PUSSY.

Follow the below steps:


1. Add your Cybertensor wallet to the [keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app) wallet in your browser (you will need your mnemonic to do this). 
After you have done so, navigate to [spacepussy.ai](https://spacepussy.ai/robot) and connect your account there.
