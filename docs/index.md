# Cybertensor Developer Documentation

:::tip See what's new
See [what's new in docs](./whats-new-in-docs.md).
:::

**Welcome!** Cybertensor is an open source platform on which you can produce competitive digital commodities. These digital commodities can be machine intelligence, storage space, compute power, protein folding, financial markets prediction, and many more. **You are rewarded in PUSSY** when you produce best digital commodities. See the below diagram for a top-level view of the Cybertensor ecosystem.

</center>

Each category of the digital commodity is produced in a distinct **subnet**. Applications are built on these specific subnets. End-users of these applications would be served by these applications.

Subnets, which exist outside the blockchain and are connected to it, are off-chain competitions where only the best producers are rewarded. A subnet consists of off-chain **subnet validators** who initiate the competition for a specific digital commodity, and off-chain **subnet miners** who compete and respond by producing the best quality digital commodity. 

Scores are assigned to the top subnet miners and subnet validators. The on-chain Yuma Consensus determines **the PUSSY rewards for these top performers**. The Cybertensor blockchain, called **subtensor**, runs on decentralized validation nodes, just like any blockchain.

:::

Cybercongress provides the open source tools, the codebase and the documentation, with step-by-step tutorials and guides, to enable you to participate in the Cybertensor ecosystem. 

:::danger This documentation is for Cybertensor platform only

This documentation and the Cybertensor codebase is for the Cybertensor platform only. For subnets and applications, refer to subnet-specific websites, which are maintained by subnet owners. See [Subnet Pages](./subnet-pages/index.md).

## Start here

If you are new to Cybertensor, start by learning the concepts. Then install the Cybertensor software and create a wallet. Follow the below links.

:::tip How to participate
A straightforward way to participate in the Cybertensor network is to be a subnet miner or a subnet validator in an existing subnet. It is not necessary to create a subnet. Follow the below links in the [Validate or mine](#validate-or-mine) section. Alternately, if you want to create your own custom incentive mechanism, then you create your own subnet and launch your own competition. See the below [Running a subnet](#running-a-subnet) section.
